# Astronomy Observations Collection

A collection of deep-sky observations and astrophotography taken during PHY160 Astronomy course using an Unistellar telescope. These observations were conducted at various locations around Orange City, Iowa, with primary observation sites at Carnes and the campus practice fields.

## Equipment Used
- **Telescope**: Unistellar eVscope (4.5-inch aperture)
- **Control**: Smartphone app for telescope operation
- **Location**: Primary sites:
  - Carnes, Iowa
  - Northwestern College campus green

## Observations

### Moon

Our lunar observation reveals detailed surface features including craters, maria (dark "seas"), and terrae (bright highlands). The Moon serves as an excellent target for testing the telescope's capabilities due to its brightness and the rich detail visible on its surface.

### M31 - Andromeda Galaxy

The Andromeda Galaxy (M31) was captured with a 15-minute exposure time. The image shows the bright central core of the galaxy and its fainter spiral arms extending outward. This observation was conducted at the Carnes site to minimize light pollution interference, which proved crucial for capturing the galaxy's faint details.

### M52 - Star Cluster

M52 is an open star cluster in the constellation Cassiopeia. Long exposures were taken for the visibility of cluster members.

### M27 - Dumbbell Nebula

M27, also known as the Dumbbell Nebula, is a planetary nebula in the constellation Vulpecula. This image captures the characteristic double-lobed structure of the nebula, showcasing the telescope's ability to capture faint nebulous objects.

## Observation Notes
- Best results achieved at Carnes site due to minimal light pollution
- Signal-to-noise ratio optimized through longer exposures
- Weather conditions, particularly wind and atmospheric turbulence, significantly impacted image quality

*These observations were conducted as part of PHY160 Astronomy course under Dr. Hyunsung's guidance.*
